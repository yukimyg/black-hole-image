## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.  
Please use **[GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)** for this project, because it's a small group.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following
things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always
> look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

- Documents
  - There are no spelling mistakes
  - It reads well
  - For english language contributions: Has a good score on
    [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) or [Hemingway
    App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
- Python Codes
  - Use code formatter [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), I will
remove things that do not respect it.
